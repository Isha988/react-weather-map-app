# ðŸ—º React Weather Map App
This is a react weather application. It uses OpenWeatherMap API for weather info, react-map-gl for map integartion and react-mapbox-autocomplete for geolocation(search box).

**User can get weather info in two ways:**

- **From Search** : The search box returns coordinates of a place which are used to position map and request weather data from api.
- **Using Map** : On click, the map also returns coordinates of the targeted place which are used to fetch data and focus map.

**Map as controlled component:**

The map is controlled using its viewState property which changes as map is moved to make it interactive.

**Map Styling**

In Mapbox, map styling is super easy with **Mapbox Styles API** (link in references)
